how my project works:
I print a "0" first. I will explain it later. And at the first loop, I begin from i=1. Every time i will plus 1.
If i%10 is 0, the second for loop will change into another line. If I begin from "0", the first line will be empty.
So I begin from 1 in the first loop. 




1. Yes. 2 loops.
2.no
