    Set up a scaner to read the file whose name is the user name. Using "j" to record how many time 
that the user has been wrong. Using the for loop to give the user 3 times to try. And print out how many time do 
the user still have to try. If the name and password is right, it will print out "welcom"+user name and break. 
If not, the user can try again if the "j" did not equal to 2. When the user was wrong for 3 
times, the programe will terminate.
	In this lab2, the user names : passwords are, koby : 1a@ b ,ej : ej ,cs112 : cs112 

Can you check if the password matches guidelines, such as containing numbers and special characters?
yes.
