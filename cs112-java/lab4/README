  I defined totalAnimals, totalMammals, totalReptiles as protected and static so I need to define every class 
with "extends". So other classes which are not their children classes cannot change them and in all subclass 
they can be used. ScientificName is defined as final and static because it won't and can't change, and in every 
subclass they can be used.
