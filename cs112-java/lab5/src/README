   I think abstract class is better. In abstract class, it can make methods,which are needed to be defined, become
 abstract. And I don't need to make other methods abstract so I don't need to defined those methods in the children
 classed again. But the con of it is that it can only extend from one file.
   For the interface, it's pros are that it lists the methods out so user can see it clearly. Also classes can
 get methods from different classes, which implements the interface. It's cons are that all methods need to be
 defined again in every class.
