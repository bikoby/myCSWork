  I think in this lab, iteration is better design.
  For iteration, it just need to create one HashMap, and put every word
and number in the HashMap after counting and comparing. And it is more 
efficient and need less codes. But it may be harder to explain.
  For recursion, it is easier to explain. But it need more codes and
is less efficient. Also I have to creat a method using index to make 
recursion.
  About comparing, I implement the Comparable interface in Word, and
add compareTo in it. I compare the numbers of words first and if the
numbers are the same, I wiil turn to compare the word.
