   All changes are made in Driver from line 181 to 279.
   I use the information in the userdata to create a ratings list [][] to save all the ratings of all users of 
movies. And then to calculate the similarity of each user using the Lab 7's code. And then to find out the most similar user with the 
user u. Then get the array list of the movies that the user has seen and have a grade larger than 3.0. And then
user the listMenu to print out the recommanded movies.
	When the ratings are changed, the ratings list will change and then the recommanded moveis will change too.
