   At first, I use b1 to check whether the first letter of username is a letter. if it is a letter,b1 become 1 and get out of the loop. 
If not, it will continue until b1=1. I create username to store the right username in the while loop. And then, I create check_number 
to check whether there is a number in the password; check_uletter to check whether there is an upper number in the password; compare to 
check whether the password contain the username; check_l to check the password's length. If they are true, they will become 1. And only if 
all of them are true, the loop will end. And I use password1 to store the password in the while loop.

How do you know that your program is correct? 
I have tried different username and password.

How does your program help user choose a valid password? For example, when user enters an invalid password, does your program tell the user 
why it was invalid? 
Yes. It will tell the user why his/her password is invalid.
