Error handling:If the file is not found, ask user for the file name. Repeat until the file exists.
 I defined a boolean "loop" as true. And then I used a while loop to repeat. If the file is exist, 
"loop" will become false and it won't get in to the while loop again. If not, ask the user for the
file name and get into the while loop again.

Error handling: If there are any number less than 0 or greater than 5 in the file, ignore the number. 
 I use a "number" to mark down the number of the numbers in the file. If the number in the file is in 
the range of 0 to 5, "number" will add 1. If not , it won't change.

Error handling: If there are any input in the file that is not a number, then stop reading numbers from the file. 
 When reading the file, I use a while loop to read it. And the condition of the while loop is 
"scan.hasNextDouble()". So if the next input is not a number, it won't read anymore.
