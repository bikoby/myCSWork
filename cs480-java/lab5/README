The dictionary is created ahead by myself, which is in the file "dictionary".
If you want to generate the dictionary again, just run "dictionaryCreate", and
type "pwd", which contains top 10,000 password in it. 

For test, run "lab3". If you want to check all the files at the same time. Just
type in all the file names in the commend line. If you want to check one file 
at a time, run "lab3" without filling in the commend line. The program will
ask you to input the file name. If you finish, just type in "n".
(PS: make sure the files are in the same directory of lab3.)
